# Analysis of international debt statistics-
This project analyzes international debt data from The World Bank, focusing on the debt owed by developing countries from 1970 to 2015. 
The dataset includes debt amounts (in USD) across various categories, offering insight into how countries manage their debt.
By writing SQL queries, I explored and answered questions such as:

1.What is the total amount of debt owed by all the countries in the dataset?

2.Which country has the highest debt, and what is the exact amount?

3.What is the average debt across different categories?
